# Banking_Website
A fully functioning Banking web interface that allows for users to create an account, open different types of banking accounts, and view their accounts. Includes database integration using Oracle Database systems.


# Notes
- Created for Java 3 Course at Bloomsburg University of PA. Not very well made so take what you want from it
- DB no longer hosted/connected so that portion is just for viewing purposes
- Rough css/html so don't be surprised
